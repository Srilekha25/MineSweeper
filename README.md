# Project: Minesweeper

## MVP

- Recreate a simplified version of the game Minesweeper to be played in the java console
- The game should be able to randomly generate 10 mines in a 10x10 grid

  - Grid will be represented by a 2 dimensional array (or array like structure)

- The user will be able to enter a command that represents a coordinate to check a location for a mine

  - (e.g "00" or "19" or "X: 0, Y: 9")

- After every guess the application should "redraw" the 2d grid. Releaving either a number from 0-8 depending on how many mines surround that location (based on the cooridnate)
- If the user selects a mine, the game will respond "boom!" and the game will be lost
- Game over screen and exit the application

- If every non-mine square has been revealed, the game is won
- Render the grid to the console after every user command

## Bonuses (optional)

- Allow for the user to configure number of mines and grid size via a configuration.json file OR command line arguments
- Keep track of win/loss in a file
  (Difficult) Discovering an empty square should reveal all squares around it, and cascade into other nearby empty squares

### Guidance

- Think about how this can be achieved in an OOP way
- A focus on single responsibility, and also maintainability/extension
- If you're lost, ask for help early
- Avoid guides, you'll just end up copying it
- If you don't understand minesweeper. Ask a coach.

### What you don't need to do

- Flag mines
- Have a fancy display. A grid with "?" "1" etc is fine

How to do it?

1. Create a grid with 10*10
enable user to click on the grid
when clicked open a block with numbers in it
then link the numbers and mines
generate mines based on the click of the user
when clicked on the mine, close the game
else continue the game
all mines found, user won
